Theme for gitweb
================

This is an alternative theme for `gitweb`_ (tested in 1.7.3.2+). It is *strongly* inspired by GitHub.

Installation
============

The installation of this stylesheet is very easy. 

Just copy the CSS-file `gitweb.css` into the gitweb folder. Best practise
would be to rename the old file, in case you want to switch back.

If you see some missing things or errors, please post a comment.
